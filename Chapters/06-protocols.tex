\chapter{Two protocols based on Spekkens contextuality}
We now generalize the self-testing result in CITE, which was discussed in Section REF, to the framework of Spekkens contextuality. In particular, this will lift the usual restriction to projective measurements. Additional features will be discussed in Section REF. The first protocol we will consider assumes approximately operationally equivalent preparations, as well as a bounded information carrying capacity, much like the protocol in Section REF. In Section REF, we will study how imposing additional assumptions on the measurement devices allows us to relax this memory assumption.
\section{Self-testing from approximately operationally equivalent preparations and bounded memory}
Let $n\geq 5$ be an odd integer. The protocol we consider is reminiscent of the ideal $n$-cycle reference experiment \ref{eqn:ncycleideal}. As such, we assume an experimenter to be able to freely choose between $n$ three-outcome measurements $\{M_i\}_{i=1}^n$ with outcomes $m_1$, $m_2$, $m_3$. We assume measurements to be chosen according to a uniform distribution and denote measurement events by $m_k\vert M_i,P_0 \equiv m_k\vert M_i$, or $m_k,m_l\vert M_i,M_j, P_0 \equiv m_k,m_l\vert M_i,M_j$ for two sequential measurements. As shown in Figure REF, for ideally operating devices, the measurement events $m_1 \vert M_i$ correspond to the rank-one projectors $\vert u_i^{(n)}\rangle\langle u_i^{(n)}\vert$. Further, in the ideal case, the measurement events $m_3\vert M_i\equiv m_1\vert M_{i\oplus 1}\equiv\vert u_{i\oplus 1}^{(n)}\rangle\langle u_{i\oplus 1}^{(n)}\vert$ and the events $m_2\vert M_i$ correspond to the projectors $\mathbb{1}-\vert u_i^{(n)}\rangle\langle u_i^{(n)}\vert-\vert u_{i\oplus 1}^{(n)}\rangle\langle u_{i\oplus 1}^{(n)}\vert$, projecting onto the pure qutrit state completing the orthogonal triad $\subset \mathbb{R}^3$. In Figure REF, the events $m_3 \vert M_i$ and $m_1\vert M_{i\oplus 1}$ are non-overlapping, despite corresponding to the same ideal projectors, to highlight we do not need to assume the operational equivalence of these.

Like in Section REF, we assume i.i.d.\ rounds, i.e. the devices to operate in an identical manner for all rounds of the protocol, in particular independently of previous input-output cycles. This allows us to lift relative frequencies to probabilities. We will discuss all other assumptions in due time. The protocol consists of the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The experimenter prepares the system in a distinguished preparation $P_0$ by selecting the appropriate setting on the corresponding device.
\item The experimenter samples from a uniform distribution and selects two integers $(i,j)\in\{1,\dots,n\}^2$ at random.
\item The experimenter performs the measurements $M_i$, $M_j$ in sequence, first $M_i$, then $M_j$. He does so by selecting the correct settings on the corresponding devices and records the outcomes.
\item Steps 1-3 are repeated to obtain estimates for the probability distributions $p((m_k,m_l)\vert (M_i,M_j),P_0)$. 
\item Additionally, the experimenter performs single measurements on two auxilliary preparations $P_1$ and $P_2$ he can choose from and obtains estimates for the probability distributions $p(m_k\vert M,i, P_j)$, for $j\in{1,2}$.
\item Post-processing
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Certify quantumness
	\item Bound compatible quantum models
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

We write the free choice of measurements $(M_i,M_j)$ and subsequent outcomes $(m_k,m_l)$ as ordered lists to indicate that the distributions $p((m_k,m_l)\vert (M_i,M_j),P_0)$ are in general not independent of the order, since we do not assume any underlying compatibility relations, like we did in Section REF. In the ideal case, the distinguished preparation $P_0$ corresponds to the $\ket{0}$ qutrit state, which produces a maximal violation of the KCBS inequality. Additionally, we assume access to two additional auxilliary preparations, $P_1$ and $P_2$, which we require to establish approximate operational equivalences during post-processing. In the ideal case the preparations $P_1$ and $P_2$ correspond to the $\ket{1}$ and $\ket{2}$ qutrit states, forming an orthogonal triad with $P_0\equiv\ket{0}\bra{0}$. The convex combination $\frac{1}{3}\sum_{i=0}^2 P_i\equiv\frac{1}{3}\sum_{i=0}^2\ket{i}\bra{i}=\frac{\mathbb{1}}{3}$ corresponds to the fully mixed state $\frac{\mathbb{1}}{3}$, as does the convex combination with equal weights of the ideal projectors corresponding to the measurement events $\{m_k\vert M_i\}_{k=1}^3$ for all $i\in\{1,\dots,n\}$. Here, we implicitly defined the convex combination of two preparations to be the preparation that is implemented by generating a random number and performing the preparation procedure associated with that outcome. We note that Steps 1-4 of the protocol correspond almost one-to-one to the steps of the protocol in CITE, which was discussed in Section REF, the only difference being that the experimenter now freely chooses between $n^2$, as opposed to $n$ measurement settings.

We now elaborate on Step 6 of the protocol, detailing how an agent may post-process the acquired data, with the goal of self-testing the apparatus. The experimenter retrospectively defines $2n$ preparations, which we denote $\{P_{m_k\vert M_i}\}_{\substack{i\in\{1,\dots,n\} \\ k\in\{1,2\}}}$. As suggested by the notation, $P_{m_k\vert M_i}$ is prepared by performing the measurement $M_i$ on a system initially prepared like $P_0$, and conditioning on the outcome $m_k$. We refer to these preparations as retrospective, since they are not directly implemented by the experimenter. However, one can infer the relevant statistics $p(m_k\vert M_i, P_{m_l\vert M_j})$ for these preparations from the distributions $p((m_k,m_l)\vert (M_i,M_j))$:
\begin{equation}
p(m_k\vert M_i, P_{m_l\vert M_j})=\frac{p((m_k,m_l)\vert (M_i,M_j))}{\sum_{k'\in\{1,2\}} p((m_{k'},m_l)\vert (M_i,M_j))}.
\end{equation}
These retrospective preparations will be used in Section REF, where we propose a criterion to certify the quantumness of the apparatus.

Additionally, the experimenter can infer the statistics $p(m_k\vert M_i, P_0)$ from the correlations $p((m_k,m_l)\vert(M_i,M_j),P_0)$:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{l,j}\frac{1}{n}p((m_k,m_l)\vert (M_i,M_j),P_0).
\end{equation}
These will become relevant in Section REF, when bounding the compatible quantum models.
\subsection{Step 6a: Certifying quantumness}
By coarse-graining, we obtain $2n$ binary measurements from the $n$ three-outcome measurements $M_i$: for each $M_i$ we ``lump together" outcomes $m_2$, $m_3$, and $m_1$, $m_3$. In total, we define $2n$ binary measurements and $2n$ preparations during post-processing. We denote the outcomes of the $2n$ binary measurements as $0$, $1$, where the outcome $0$ corresponds to the two coarse-grained measurement events. If we consider the ideal reference experiment REF and take the outcomes $0$, $1$ to be the eigenvalues of the binary projective measurements, one can think of these as rank-one projectors. There are $n$ ideal binary measurements that probe the probability of finding the system in one of the $n$ one-dimensional subspaces spanned by the $n$ cycle states. The other $n$ ideal binary measurements correspond to rank-one projectors onto states in an orthogonal triad containing two cycle states. For the extent of this subsection we will for simplicity index the $2n$ binary measurements and preparations like $\{M_i\}_{i\in\{1,\dots,2n\}}$ and $\{P_i\}_{i\in\{1,\dots,2n\}}$. For ideal measurements and preparations, we can choose the order such that the ideal measurement $M_i$ is the rank-one projector onto the ideal pure state preparation $P_i$. Therefore, for ideal devices, the retrospective preparations and binary measurements, if ordered in this manner, satisfy \begin{equation}
\epsilon \coloneqq \max_i p(0\vert M_i, P_i)\stackrel{\text{ideal}}{=}0.
\end{equation} 
For noisy devices, we expect to find an ordering for which REF is approximately satisfied, with the parameter $\epsilon$ characterizing the amount of noise. The parameter $\epsilon$ can be determined from the observed statistics during post-processing.

Apart from the noise-characterizing parameter $\epsilon$, the second relevant parameter for certifying quantumness is
\begin{equation}
\eta\coloneqq \min_{\substack{i,j \\ i\neq j}} p(0\vert M_i, P_j).
\end{equation}
For quantum devices, the parameter $\eta$ can be thought of as a measuring the maximum overlap or closeness of distinct states. As such, $\eta$ decreases as the cycle length $n$ increases. Let $m=2^k$. In Theorem REF of CITE it is proven that for a set of preparations $\{P_i\}_{i=1}^m$ and measurements $\{M_i\}_{i=1}^m$, producing statistics obeying $\epsilon<\frac{1}{4}\eta^2$, to be compatible with a (preparation) non-contextual ontological description, requires at least $k$ binary measurements in any TC set. The intuition behind this is the following: From the statistics of the $m$ preparations $\{P_i\}_{i=1}^m$ one can infer the statistics of any preparation in the convex hull of the $\{P_i\}_{i=1}^m$. If the $m$ preparations are not very ``close", as measured by $\eta$, relative to their sharpness, as measured by $\epsilon$, (this is enforced by the condition $\epsilon<\frac{1}{4}\eta^2$) then the associated probability density functions $\{\mu_i\}_{i=1}^m$ will have non-significant overlap. In particular, if we regard the $m$ probability density functions on the ontic state space $\Lambda$ as vectors $\{v_i\}_{i=1}^m$ in $\mathbb{R}^{\vert \Lambda \vert}$, then the proof of Theorem REF in CITE establishes that the $m=2^k$ vectors vary in $k$ linearly independent directions. Demanding preparation non-contextuality, every distinct preparation in the convex hull of the $\{P\}_{i=1}^n$ must produce different predictions for at least one of the measurements in a TC set. Finally, CITE notes that the function mapping a probability density function $\mu_j$, or rather the corresponding vector in $\mathbb{R}^{\vert \Lambda \vert}$ to the probability $p(m_k\vert M_i,\mu_j)$ of obtaining the outcome $m_k$ when performing the measurement $M_i$ for an initial preparation $\mu_j$ is linear. Hence, such mapping $\mathbb{R}^{\vert \Lambda \vert}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is of the form $(x_1,\dots,x_{\vert \Lambda \vert})\mapsto a_1 x_1+\dots + a_n x_n = \vec{a}\cdot \vec{x}$ with $0 \leq a_i \leq 1$, and $x_i$ the components w.r.t\ the basis $\{v_i\}_{i=1}^m$. Binary measurements can therefore only distinguish between preparations along a single direction, $\vec{a}$. Preparations whose ontological representations differ w.r.t.\ directions orthogonal to $\vec{a}$, are assigned the same probabilities by the binary measurement characterized by $\vec{a}$. A TC set of measurement must contain at least $k$ binary measurements for $k$ linearly independent preparations, if we demand compatiblity with a preparation non-contextual ontological model.

We now turn to the bounded memory assumption required by the protocol, which relies on the results in CITE, the relevant ones of which were sketched above. Assume that the experimenter has access to $n\geq 5$ three-outcome measurement settings, like we considered at the beginning of Section REF, where $n$ is odd (think of $n$ as the cycle-length). Further, let $k$ be the largest integer satisfying $2n\geq 2^{k+1}$. To certify quantumness, we assume that there exists a TC set of measurements with $k$ binary measurements, i.e. that $k$ binary measurements are sufficient to fully characterize the statistics of the system at hand. If we find the condition $\epsilon<\frac{1}{4}\eta^2$ to be satisfied, we consider the system to be quantum.  How does this assumption relate to the assumption of bounded memory in Section REF? If we define the information carrying capacity as 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{I}\coloneqq \log_2(\text{number of states that can be perfectly distinguished}),
\end{equation}
then assuming a TC set with $k$ measurements implies bounding the information carrying capacity $\mathcal{I}\leq k$ bits. In this sense, assumptions regarding the minimal size of TC sets of measurements directly relate to bounds on the information carrying capacity. In particular, bounding the information carrying capacity $\mathcal{I}\leq k \text{bits}$ implies a finite-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, $\operatorname{dim}(\mathcal{H})\leq k$.

If we wish to allow for an information carrying capacity of $k$ bits, we require an apparatus consistent with a cycle length $n$ such that
\begin{alignat}{2}
& && 2n\geq 2^{k+1} \\
& \iff && \log_2(n)\geq k.
\end{alignat}
The relationship between cycle length and simulable bound on the information carrying capacity is logarithmic, as was the case for the class of protocols in Section REF, which assumed sharp measurements and cyclic compatibility relations. The price one has to pay for accounting for a greater information carrying capacity is two-fold:
\begin{itemize}
\item the apparatus must include additional measurement settings to be consistent with a greater cycle length $n$
\item for a greater cycle-length $n$, a greater fidelity to the reference experiment is required, since for the ideal odd $n$-cycle scenario the relevant parameter $\frac{1}{4}\eta^2$, which bounds how sharp the measurement implementations must be for self-testing, decreases with an increasing cycle length $n$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{4}\eta^2 = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{\pi}{n})^4.
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Step 6b: Bounding compatible quantum models}
As discussed in Section REF, we assume a Hilbert space of bounded dimension, say dimension $\operatorname{dim}(\mathcal{H})\leq d$. We can w.l.o.g.\ take $\mathcal{H}$ to be $\mathbb{C}^k$, $k\leq d$, where $k$ is the true dimension of $\mathcal{H}$. For notational simplicity we define $P_{m_3\vert M_i}\coloneqq P_{m_1\vert M_{i\oplus 1}}$.

We will now introduce the second key assumption of the protocol, which allows us to bound the quantum models compatible with the observed correlations: We assume that for all $i\in\{1,\dots,n\}$ there exists a convex combination $\{p_j^{(i)}\}_j$ of the preparations $\{P_{m_j\vert M_i}\}_j$ and a convex combination $\{q_j^{(*)}\}_j$ of the preparations $\{P_0,P_1,P_2\}$ such that these are (approximately) operationally equivalent:
\begin{equation}
\forall i\in\{1,\dots,n\} S_i \coloneqq \sum_{j=1}^3 p_j^{(i)}P_{m_j\vert M_i} \sim S_* \coloneqq \sum_{j=0}^2 q_j^{(*)}P_j.
\end{equation}
Although assuming approximate operational equivalences suffices, we will for now take the equivalences in REF to be exact. Once we establish bounds on the compatible quantum models for exact equivalences, this restriction may be relaxed. We consider two quantum preparations to be approximately operationally equivalent if the corresponding density operators are ``close" w.r.t.\ the Frobenius norm. Recall that for ideal devices and equal weights $p_j^{(i)}=q_j^{(*)}=\frac{1}{3}$, both $S_i$ and $S_{*}$ correspond to the fully mixed state $\frac{\mathbb{1}}{3}$. Note that the assumption of (approximate) operational equivalence cannot be verified on the basis of statistics alone, rendering the protocol semi-device-independent. What one can do is check whether the claim holds w.r.t.\ the available measurement settings. The reason for assuming the convex combinations $S_i$ and $S_{*}$ to be (approximately) operationally equivalent is to relate the action of the measurements $M_i$ on the preparations $P_{m_j\vert M_i}$ to how the measurements act on the initial preparation $P_0$. In particular, we want that if the measurements $M_i$ are almost projective when acting on the preparations $P_{m_j\vert M_i}$, then this also applies to the preparation $P_0$.

Denote the density operator corresponding to the preparation $P_{m_k\vert M_i}$ by 
\begin{equation}
\rho_{m_k\vert M_i} = \sum_m p_m^{m_k\vert M_i} \vert \Psi_m^{m_k\vert M_i}\rangle\langle \Psi_m^{m_k\vert M_i} \vert,
\end{equation} $\vert \Psi_m^{m_k\vert M_i} \rangle \in \mathbb{C}^k$, and the positive semi-definite operator corresponding to the measurement event $m_k\vert M_i$ by
\begin{equation}
F_{m_k\vert M_i}=\sum_l \lambda_l^{m_k\vert M_i} \vert \alpha_l^{m_k\vert M_i}\rangle \langle \alpha_l^{m_k\vert M_i} \vert,
\end{equation} $\vert \alpha_l^{m_k\vert M_i} \rangle \in \mathbb{C}^k$.
By REF,
\begin{align}
p(m_k\vert M_i, P_{m_k\vert M_i}) & \geq 1-2\epsilon \\
p(m_k\vert M_i, P_{m_{k'}\vert M_i}) & \leq \epsilon,
\end{align}
for $k'\neq k$.
Therefore,
\begin{equation}
\sum_{l,m}\lambda_l^{m_k\vert M_i}p_m^{m_k\vert M_i}\vert \langle \alpha_l^{m_k\vert M_i} \vert \Psi_m^{m_k\vert M_i} \rangle \vert^2 \geq 1-2\epsilon
\end{equation}
and analogously, for $k'\neq k$,
\begin{equation}
\sum_{l,m}\lambda_l^{m_k\vert M_i}p_m^{m_{k'}\vert M_i}\vert \langle \alpha_l^{m_k\vert M_i} \vert \Psi_m^{m_{k'}\vert M_i} \rangle \vert^2 \leq \epsilon.
\end{equation}
Later, we will consider the behaviour for $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$

We want to show that the measurement $M_i$ acts ``almost projectively" on the preparations $\{P_{m_j\vert M_i}\}_{j=1}^3$, and by extension on $P_0$. Consider the density operator $\rho_{m_k\vert M_i}$, like in REF. For eigenvalues $p_m^{m_k\vert M_i}$ of the noisy density operator that are very small, say of the order $\epsilon$, we cannot infer from the statistics $\{p(m_j\vert M_i, P_{m_k\vert M_i})\}_{j,k}$ alone whether the measurement $M_i$ acts almost projectively on the corresponding subspace $\mathbb{C}\vert \Psi_m^{m_k\vert M_i}\rangle$, since this subspace is insignificant in terms of statistics. In order to sidestep this issue, we consider only a ``statistically relevant" subspace of $\mathbb{C}^k$:
Define $\Pi_{\text{relev}}^{(i)}$ as the projector onto the subspace 
\begin{equation}
V_{\text{relev}}^{(i)}=\operatorname{span}(\bigcup_{k=1}^3\{\vert \Psi_m^{m_k\vert M_i}\rangle\}_{m:p_m^{m_k\vert M_i}\geq\mathcal{X}}).
\end{equation}
For now, $\mathcal{X}$ is an arbitrary cutoff, characterizing the minimum magnitude of eigenvalues for which the corresponding eigenvector in REF spans a statistically relevant one-dimensional subspace. We will later set $\mathcal{X}$ to an appropriate value in terms of $\epsilon$. Implementing this technical workaround, the condition REF and REF become
\begin{equation}
\sum_{m:p_m^{m_k\vert M_i}\geq \mathcal{X}} (1-\sum_l \lambda_l^{m_k\vert M_i} \vert \langle \alpha_l^{m_k\vert M_i}\vert \Psi_m^{m_k\vert M_i} \rangle \vert^2)\leq \frac{2\epsilon}{\mathcal{X}}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\sum_{l,m:p_m^{m_{k'}\vert M_i}\geq \mathcal{X}} \lambda_l^{m_k\vert M_i} \vert \langle \alpha_l^{m_k\vert M_i}\vert \Psi_m^{m_{k'}\vert M_i} \rangle \vert^2\leq \frac{\epsilon}{\mathcal{X}},
\end{equation}
for $k'\neq k$.

\subsubsection{Overlap between statistically relevant states}
We begin by bounding the overlap $\vert \langle \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\vert \Psi_l^{m_{j'}\vert M_i}\rangle \vert$, for $j'\neq j$ and $\vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle, \vert \Psi_l^{m_{j'}\vert M_i}\rangle \in V_{\text{relev}}^{(i)}$. In the ideal case these vectors are perfectly orthogonal. For notational simplicity, we will write $\sum_{k:p_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\geq \mathcal{X}}$ as $\sum'_k$, and analogously for two summation indices.
Using the fact that $\sum_{\Tilde{j}}F_{m_{\Tilde{j}}\vert M_i}=\mathbb{1}$, we can re-write
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k,l}{}^{'}\vert\langle \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i} \vert \Psi_l^{m_{j'}\vert M_i}\rangle \vert = \sum_{k,l}{}^{'}\vert \sum_{\Tilde{j}} \operatorname{tr}(F_{m_{\Tilde{j}}\vert M_i}\vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle\langle \Psi_l^{m_{j'}\vert M_i}\vert) \vert.
\end{equation}
This is upper-bounded by
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k,l}{}^{'}\vert\langle \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i} \vert \Psi_l^{m_{j'}\vert M_i}\rangle \vert \leq \sum_{\Tilde{j},m}\sum_{k,l}{}^{'}\lambda_m^{m_{\Tilde{j}}\vert M_i}\vert \langle \alpha_m^{m_{\Tilde{j}}\vert M_i} \vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i} \rangle \vert \vert \langle \Psi_l^{m_{j'}\vert M_i}\vert \alpha_m^{m_{\Tilde{j}}\vert M_i} \rangle \vert.
\end{equation}
Note that since $j\neq j'$, $\Tilde{j}\neq j$ or $\Tilde{j}\neq j'$. We now use condition REF. REF bounds the square of the 2-norm of the vector with entries
\begin{equation*}
\left((\lambda_m^{m_{\Tilde{j}}\vert M_i})^{\frac{1}{2}}\vert \langle \alpha_m^{m_{\Tilde{j}}\vert M_i}\vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle \vert\right)_{m,l:p_l^{m_j\vert M_i}\geq \mathcal{X}}\;,
\end{equation*} 
for $\Tilde{j}\neq j$. Such vector has at most $d^2$ components, where $d$ is the upper bound on the Hilbert space dimension we imposed in Section REF. Since $\|\cdot\|_1$ and $\|\cdot\|_2$ are equivalent, with $\|\vec{x}\|_1\leq \sqrt{k}\|\vec{x}\|_2$ for $\vec{x}\in\mathbb{C}^k$, we find
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k,m}{}^{'}\lambda_m^{m_{\Tilde{j}}\vert M_i}\vert \langle \alpha_m^{m_{\Tilde{j}}\vert M_i}\vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle \vert \leq d\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{\mathcal{X}}},
\end{equation}
for $\Tilde{j}\neq j$, and
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k,l}{}^{'}\vert\langle \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i} \vert \Psi_l^{m_{j'}\vert M_i}\rangle \vert \leq 3 d^2\sqrt{\frac{2\epsilon}{\mathcal{X}}}.
\end{equation}
We could drop the factor $3$, since for sufficiently small $\epsilon$, the set of all vectors is linearly independent.
\subsubsection{Orthonormal set $\subset \mathbb{C}^k$ close to the set of relevant eigenvectors}
In the following subsection, we will bound the Frobenius distance
\begin{equation}
\|F_{m_j\vert M_i}\Pi_{\text{relev}}^{(i)}-\sum_{k}{}^{'}\vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle \langle \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\vert \|_F
\end{equation}
Recall that the Frobenius norm of an operator $A\in\mathbb{C}^{k,k}$ is defined in terms of the trace of $A^{\dag}A$. The trace of $A^{\dag}A$ is conveniently expressed in terms of an orthonormal basis $\{\vert \phi_j \rangle\}_j\subset \mathbb{C}^k$: $\sum_j \langle \phi_j \vert A^{\dag}A \vert \phi_j \rangle$. However, the conditions REF are all expressed in terms of the states $\bigcup\limits_{j=1}^3\{\vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i} \rangle\}_k$, which are in general not orthogonal. Therefore, we want to find an orthonormal set $\bigcup\limits_{j=1}^3\{\vert \Phi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle\}_{k:p_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\geq \mathcal{X}}\subset\mathbb{C}^k$ closest to $\mathcal{E}\coloneqq\bigcup\limits_{j=1}^3\{\vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle\}_{k:p_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\geq \mathcal{X}}\subset\mathbb{C}^k$, in the sense that the quantity
\begin{equation}
\sum_{j}\sum_{k}{}^{'}\|\vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i} \rangle - \vert \Phi_k^{m_j\vert M_i} \rangle \|_2.
\end{equation}
is small for all $j$, $k$.

Let $k'$ be the cardinality of the set $\mathcal{E}$.
Define $A\in\mathbb{C}^{k,k'}$ as the matrix with columns $\mathcal{E}\subset\mathbb{C}^k$. Note that $k\geq k'$ for sufficiently small $\epsilon$, since all columns are linearly independent.The entries of the matrix $A^{\dag}A$ are essentially just the scalar products whose magnitude we bounded in Section REF. Some off-diagonal entries, namely those corresponding to the scalar product of two vectors that are part of the same spectral decomposition, are $0$. Finally, the diagonal entries of $A^{\dag}A$ are all $1$, due to normalization. Like in the proof of Lemma REF, we consider a spectral decomposition of $A$, $A=V\Sigma W^{\dag}$, and denote the rank of $A$ by $r$. Analogously to the proof of Lemma REF, we consider the matrix $\Tilde{A}=$, where we have set all diagonal entries of $\Sigma$ to $1$. The columns of $\Tilde{A}$ are orthonormal. It remains to show that $A\approx_F \Tilde{A}$:
\begin{equation}
\|A-\Tilde{A}\|_F^2=\|\begin{pmatrix} \mathbb{1_{k'}} \\ 0_{k-k',k'}\end{pmatrix} - \Sigma \|_F^2 = (k'-r)+\sum_{i=1}^{r}(\sigma_i-1)^2.
\end{equation}
We now use REF to bound the singular values and rank of $A$:
\begin{equation}
\|A^{\dag}A - \mathbb{1} \|_F^2 = (k'-r)+\sum_{i=1}^r(\sigma_i^2-1)^2 \leq \mathcal{O}(d^4\frac{\epsilon}{\mathcal{X}}),
\end{equation}
where the inequality follows from REF. Thus, for sufficiently small $\epsilon$ the rank of $A$ is $r=k'$, and
\begin{equation}
\|A-\Tilde{A}\|_F^2=\sum_{i=1}^{k'}(\sigma_i - 1)^2\leq\sum_{i=1}^{k'}(\sigma_i - 1)^2(\sigma_i+1)^2\leq\mathcal{O}(d^4\frac{\epsilon}{\mathcal{X}}).
\end{equation}
As such, the orthonormal set $\bigcup\limits_{j=1}^3\{\vert \Phi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle\}_{k:p_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\geq \mathcal{X}}\subset\mathbb{C}^k$, given by the columns of $\Tilde{A}$, satisfies
\begin{equation}
\sum_{j=1}^3\sum_k{}^{'}\|\vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i} \rangle - \vert \Phi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle \|_2^2=\|A-\Tilde{A}\|_F^2\leq \mathcal{O}(d^4\frac{\epsilon}{\mathcal{X}})
\end{equation}
Such a set can be found for all $i\in\{1,\dots,n\}$.
\subsubsection{The measurement $M_i$ acts almost projectively on the subspace $V_{\text{relev}}^{(i)}$}
We now bound the expression
\begin{equation}
\|F_{m_j\vert M_i}\Pi_{\text{relev}}^{(i)}-\sum_{k}{}^{'}\vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle \langle \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\vert \|_F,
\end{equation}
or rather
\begin{equation}
\|F_{m_j\vert M_i}\Pi_{\text{relev}}^{(i)}-\sum_{k}{}^{'}\vert \Phi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle \langle \Phi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\vert \|_F,
\end{equation}
in order to show that the measurement $M_i$ acts almost projectively on the subspace $V_{\text{relev}}^{(i)}$. As a first step, we first bound
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\|\Pi_{\text{relev}}^{(i)}-\sum_j\sum_k{}^{'}\vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle \langle \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\vert \|_F & \leq \sum_j\sum_k{}^{'}\| \vert \Phi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle \langle \Phi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\vert-\vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle \langle \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\vert\|_F \\
& =\sqrt{2}\sum_j\sum_k{}^{'}\sqrt{1-\vert \langle \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i} \vert \Phi_k^{m_j\vert M_i} \rangle \vert^2}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Notice that
\begin{equation}
\|A-\Tilde{A}\|_F^2=\sum_j\sum_k{}^{'}\|\vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i} \rangle - \vert \Phi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle\|_2^2=2\sum_j\sum_k{}^{'}(1-\vert\langle \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i} \vert \Phi_k^{m_j\vert M_i} \rangle \vert).
\end{equation}
We can write 
\begin{equation}
\vert \Phi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle = \cos(\theta_k^{m_j\vert M_i})\vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle + \exp(i\phi_k^{m_j\vert M_i})\sin(\theta_k^{m_j\vert M_i})\vert \Psi_{k,\perp}^{m_j\vert M_i} \rangle, 
\end{equation}
where $\cos(\theta_k^{m_j\vert M_i})= \vert\langle \Phi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\vert\Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i} \rangle\vert$ for $\theta_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\in[0,\frac{\pi}{2}]$, $\phi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}$ is some phase, and $\vert \Psi_{k,\perp}^{m_j\vert M_i} \rangle$ is a state perpendicular to $\vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle$.
Thus, equations REF can be rewritten like
\begin{align}
& \|\Pi_{\text{relev}}^{(i)}-\sum_j\sum_k{}^{'}\vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle \langle \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\vert \|_F\leq\sqrt{2}\sum_j\sum_k{}^{'}\sin(\theta_k^{m_j\vert M_i}), \\
& \|A-\Tilde{A}\|_F^2=\sum_j\sum_k{}^{'}\|\vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i} \rangle - \vert \Phi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle\|_2^2=2\sum_j\sum_k{}^{'}2\sin^2\left(\frac{\theta_k^{m_j\vert M_i}}{2}\right).
\end{align}
Like in Section REF, equivalence of $\|\cdot\|_1$ and $\|\cdot\|_2$ norms, allows us to write:
\begin{equation}
2\sum_j\sum_k{}^{'}\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\leq \mathcal{O}\left(d^{5/2}\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{\mathcal{X}}}\right).
\end{equation}
For all $0\leq \theta \leq 2\pi$, $2\sin(\frac{\theta}{2})-\sin(\theta)\geq 0$, therefore
\begin{equation}
\|\Pi_{\text{relev}}^{(i)}-\sum_j\sum_k{}^{'}\vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle \langle \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\vert \|_F = \sqrt{2}\sum_j\sum_k{}^{'}\sin(\theta_k^{m_j\vert M_i})\leq\mathcal{O}\left(d^{5/2}\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{\mathcal{X}}}\right).
\end{equation}
We now bound REF:
\begin{equation}
\|F_{m_j\vert M_i}\Pi_{\text{relev}}^{(i)}-\sum_{k}{}^{'}\vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle \langle \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\vert \|_F \leq \mathcal{O}\left(d^{5/2}\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{\mathcal{X}}}\right)+\|(F_{m_j\vert M_i}-\mathbb{1})\sum_k{}^{'}\vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i} \rangle \langle \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i} \vert \|_F.
\end{equation}
The last term in REF satisfies
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\|(F_{m_j\vert M_i}-\mathbb{1})\sum_k{}^{'}\vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i} \rangle \langle \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i} \vert \|_F^2 & =\operatorname{tr}((F_{m_j\vert M_i}-\mathbb{1})^2\sum_k{}^{'}\vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i} \rangle \langle \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i} \vert) \\
& \leq \sum_k{}^{'}(1-\sum_l \lambda_l^{m_j\vert M_i}\vert \langle \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\vert \alpha_l^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle \vert ^2)
\end{split},
\end{equation}
where the rightmost term is small due to REF. Hence, we arrive at
\begin{equation}
\|F_{m_j\vert M_i}\Pi_{\text{relev}}^{(i)}-\sum_{k}{}^{'}\vert \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle \langle \Psi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\vert \|_F \leq \mathcal{O}\left(d^{5/2}\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{\mathcal{X}}}\right),
\end{equation}
or alternatively
\begin{equation}
\|F_{m_j\vert M_i}\Pi_{\text{relev}}^{(i)}-\sum_{k}{}^{'}\vert \Phi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle \langle \Phi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\vert \|_F \leq \mathcal{O}\left(d^{5/2}\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{\mathcal{X}}}\right).
\end{equation}
The operators $\{\sum_{k}{}^{'}\vert \Phi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\rangle \langle \Phi_k^{m_j\vert M_i}\vert\}_{j\in\{1,2,3\}}$ are orthogonal projectors.
\subsubsection{Why can we confine our analysis to the subspace $V_{\text{relev}}^{(i)}$?}
We now discuss in what sense the assumption regarding operational equivalences of preparations, introduced at the beginning of Section REF, justifies confining our analysis to only the subspace $V_{\text{relev}}^{(i)}$. 
For the convex combinations $S_i$, as defined in REF, we find:
\begin{equation}
\|\sum_j p_j^{(i)}(\rho_{m_j\vert M_i}-\Pi_{\text{relev}}^{(i)}\rho_{m_j\vert M_i}\Pi_{\text{relev}}^{(i)})\|_F \leq \sum_j p_j^{(i)}\|\rho_{m_j\vert M_i}-\Pi_{\text{relev}}^{(i)}\rho_{m_j\vert M_i}\Pi_{\text{relev}}^{(i)}\|_F \leq \sqrt{d}\mathcal{X}.
\end{equation}
Due to operational equivalence $S_i\sim S_{*}$, we can write:
\begin{equation}
\|\sum_j q_j^{(*)}(\rho_{j}-\Pi_{\text{relev}}^{(i)}\rho_{j}\Pi_{\text{relev}}^{(i)})\|_F \leq \sqrt{d}\mathcal{X},
\end{equation}
where $\rho_{j}$ is the density operator corresponding to the preparation $P_j$.
