In theory, we could account for an arbitrarily high information carrying capacity by including more preparations and measurements in the experiment, the trade-off being that more measurements and preparations will require a greater fidelity to the ideal reference experiment REF. The advantage over the protocol in Section REF is that we relax Assumption REF about the sharpness of measurements and allow for general POVM quantum measurements. Additionally, the new protocol consists of a prepare-and-measure experiment and therefore does not require sequential measurements, allowing for further related assumptions to be relaxed.
