\chapter{Two protocols based on Spekkens contextuality}

\section{Self-testing from approximately operationally equivalent preparations and bounded memory}
Let $n\geq 5$ be an odd integer. The protocol we consider is reminiscent of the ideal $n$-cycle reference experiment \ref{eqn:ncycleideal}. As such, we assume an experimenter to be able to freely choose between $n$ three-outcome measurements $\{M_i\}_{i=1}^n$ with outcomes $m_1$, $m_2$, $m_3$. We assume measurements to be chosen according to a uniform distribution and denote measurement events by $m_k\vert M_i,P_0 \equiv m_k\vert M_i$, or $m_k,m_l\vert M_i,M_j, P_0 \equiv m_k,m_l\vert M_i,M_j$ for two sequential measurements. As shown in Figure REF, for ideally operating devices, the measurement events $m_1 \vert M_i$ correspond to the rank-one projectors $\vert u_i^{(n)}\rangle\langle u_i^{(n)}\vert$. Further, in the ideal case, the measurement events $m_3\vert M_i\equiv m_1\vert M_{i\oplus 1}\equiv\vert u_{i\oplus 1}^{(n)}\rangle\langle u_{i\oplus 1}^{(n)}\vert$ and the events $m_2\vert M_i$ correspond to the projectors $\mathbb{1}-\vert u_i^{(n)}\rangle\langle u_i^{(n)}\vert-\vert u_{i\oplus 1}^{(n)}\rangle\langle u_{i\oplus 1}^{(n)}\vert$, projecting onto the pure qutrit state completing the orthogonal triad $\subset \mathbb{R}^3$. In Figure REF, the events $m_3 \vert M_i$ and $m_1\vert M_{i\oplus 1}$ are non-overlapping, despite corresponding to the same ideal projectors, to highlight we do not need to assume the operational equivalence of these.

Like in Section REF, we assume i.i.d.\ rounds, i.e. the devices to operate in an identical manner for all rounds of the protocol, in particular independently of previous input-output cycles. This allows us to lift relative frequencies to probabilities. We will discuss all other assumptions in due time. The protocol consists of the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The experimenter prepares the system in a distinguished preparation $P_0$ by selecting the appropriate setting on the corresponding device.
\item The experimenter samples from a uniform distribution and selects two integers $(i,j)\in\{1,\dots,n\}^2$ at random.
\item The experimenter performs the measurements $M_i$, $M_j$ in sequence, first $M_i$, then $M_j$. He does so by selecting the correct settings on the corresponding devices and records the outcomes.
\item Steps 1-3 are repeated to obtain estimates for the probability distributions $p((m_k,m_l)\vert (M_i,M_j),P_0)$. 
\item Additionally, the experimenter performs single measurements on two auxilliary preparations $P_1$ and $P_2$ he can choose from and obtains estimates for the probability distributions $p(m_k\vert M,i, P_j)$, for $j\in{1,2}$.
\item Post-processing
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Certify quantumness
	\item Bound compatible quantum models
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

We write the free choice of measurements $(M_i,M_j)$ and subsequent outcomes $(m_k,m_l)$ as ordered lists to indicate that the distributions $p((m_k,m_l)\vert (M_i,M_j),P_0)$ are in general not independent of the order, since we do not assume any underlying compatibility relations, like we did in Section REF. In the ideal case, the distinguished preparation $P_0$ corresponds to the $\ket{0}$ qutrit state, which produces a maximal violation of the KCBS inequality. Additionally, we assume access to two additional auxilliary preparations, $P_1$ and $P_2$, which we require to establish approximate operational equivalences during post-processing. In the ideal case the preparations $P_1$ and $P_2$ correspond to the $\ket{1}$ and $\ket{2}$ qutrit states, forming an orthogonal triad with $P_0\equiv\ket{0}\bra{0}$. The convex combination $\frac{1}{3}\sum_{i=0}^2 P_i\equiv\frac{1}{3}\sum_{i=0}^2\ket{i}\bra{i}=\frac{\mathbb{1}}{3}$ corresponds to the fully mixed state $\frac{\mathbb{1}}{3}$, as does the convex combination with equal weights of the ideal projectors corresponding to the measurement events $\{m_k\vert M_i\}_{k=1}^3$ for all $i\in\{1,\dots,n\}$. Here, we implicitly defined the convex combination of two preparations to be the preparation that is implemented by generating a random number and performing the preparation procedure associated with that outcome. We note that Steps 1-4 of the protocol correspond almost one-to-one to the steps of the protocol in CITE, which was discussed in Section REF, the only difference being that the experimenter now freely chooses between $n^2$, as opposed to $n$ measurement settings.

We now elaborate on Step 6 of the protocol, detailing how an agent may post-process the acquired data, with the goal of self-testing the apparatus. The experimenter retrospectively defines $3n$ preparations, which we denote $\{P_{m_k\vert M_i}\}_{\substack{i\in\{1,\dots,n\} \\ k\in\{1,2,3\}}}$. As suggested by the notation, $P_{m_k\vert M_i}$ is prepared by performing the measurement $M_i$ on a system initially prepared like $P_0$, and conditioning on the outcome $m_k$. We refer to these preparations as retrospective, since they are not directly implemented by the experimenter. However, one can infer the relevant statistics $p(m_k\vert M_i, P_{m_l\vert M_j})$ for these preparations from the distributions $p((m_k,m_l)\vert (M_i,M_j))$:
\begin{equation}
p(m_k\vert M_i, P_{m_l\vert M_j})=\frac{p((m_k,m_l)\vert (M_i,M_j))}{\sum_{k'\in\{1,2,3\}} p((m_{k'},m_l)\vert (M_i,M_j))}.
\end{equation}
These retrospective preparations will be used in Section REF, where we propose a criterion to certify the quantumness of the apparatus.
\subsection{Step 6a: Certifying quantumness}
By coarse-graining, we obtain $3n$ binary measurements from the $n$ three-outcome measurements $M_i$. In total, we define $3n$ binary measurements and $3n$ preparations during post-processing. We denote the outcomes of the $3n$ binary measurements as $0$,$1$, where the outcome $0$ corresponds to the two coarse-grained measurement events. If we consider the ideal reference experiment REF and take the outcomes $0$, $1$ to be the eigenvalues of the binary projective measurements, one can think of these as rank-one projectors. There are $2n$ ideal binary measurements that probe the probability of finding the system in one of the $n$ one-dimensional subspaces spanned by the $n$ cycle states. The other $n$ ideal binary measurements correspond to rank-one projectors onto states in an orthogonal triad containing two cycle states. For the extent of this subsection we will for simplicity index the $3n$ binary measurements and preparations like $\{M_i\}_{i\in\{1,\dots,3n\}}$ and $\{P_i\}_{i\in\{1,\dots,3n\}}$, ordered such that the ideal measurement $M_i$
