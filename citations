  abstract      = {Characterising unknown quantum states and measurements is a fundamental problem in quantum information processing. In this Letter, we provide a novel scheme to self-test local quantum systems using non-contextuality inequalities. Our work leverages the graph-theoretic framework for contextuality introduced by Cabello, Severini, and Winter, combined with tools from mathematical optimisation that guarantee the unicity of optimal solutions. As an application, we show that the celebrated Klyachko-Can-Biniciogglu-Shumovsky inequality and its generalisation to contextuality scenarios with odd n-cycle compatibility relations admit robust self-testing.},
